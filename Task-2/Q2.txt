#To find Nth number in Fibonacci series

input(n)

a = 0
b = 1
i = 0

while n < i:
	temp = a + b
	a = b
	b = temp
	i = i+1
	return(a)

output(a)

//Variables:
 a - number in Fibonacci series
 b - number in Fibonacci series
 i - variable to run loop
 n - limiting variable
 temp - temporary variable to store value
