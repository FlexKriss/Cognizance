The Bee Game
An online multiplayer browser game

--------------------------------

The bee game is an online co-op multiplayer game, where you and your fellow friends play as bees, 
trying to collect as much nectar as possible from a flower, While the enemy team tries to do the same.
Staying on top of a flower gives you nectar points.
If both teams are on top of the same flower, it becomes contested and neither of the teams get points till they drive the other team out.
First to fill up the bar /Most points when the time gets over wins.

Different types of bees have different abilities and different gameplay.
